<p class="mb-4">
  This article will go over processes count and whether or not you need to concern yourself with lowering them.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  Let's start off with the key source of information people turn to when arguing against the process counter,
  <a href="https://zusier.xyz/blog/posts/process-count-doesnt-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
     class="text-blue-600 underline">
    Zusier's Blog
  </a>.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  I highly recommend you check out the blog for yourself, but to summarize the key point... he ran a test where he made
  a single process as heavy as possible; it ended up comparable to 1,000+ Discord instances and completely locked his system —
  all from one process.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  Then Zusier did the opposite: he created 3,000 processes that only slept. And he could still play games perfectly fine.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  The conclusion he wants people to understand is that
  <span class="underline font-semibold">the number itself is not the problem</span>;
  rather,
  <span class="underline font-semibold">specific processes causing load are the problem</span>.
  To truly know what’s slowing down your machine, you should look at metrics like
  <span class="font-semibold">Cycles Delta</span> and <span class="font-semibold">Context Switch Delta</span>
  (available in
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
     class="text-blue-600 underline">
    Process Explorer
  </a>).
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What are these measurements indicative of?</h3>

<div class="mb-4">
  <p class="font-bold">Cycles Delta:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-1">
    <li>The number of CPU clock cycles used between samples. Shows how much “work” the CPU is doing.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <p class="font-bold">Context Switching Delta:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-1">
    <li>The change in context switches between samples. High deltas indicate task-switching overhead.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="mb-4">
  In simple terms: these values help you see what’s eating at your CPU, which often correlates to reduced performance.

     target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
     class="text-blue-600 underline">

  </a>,
  you can enable these by right-clicking any column, selecting “Select Columns,” and enabling
  <span class="font-semibold">CPU Cycles Delta</span> and
  <span class="font-semibold">Context Switch Delta</span>.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What should you disable?</h3>

<p class="mb-4">
  A great place to start is disabling startup applications. After that, close things like Spotify, Discord, browsers,
  or anything else running in the background. You can check some of what’s running in your tray icons.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What about disabling Windows Services?</h3>

<p class="mb-4">
  Disabling Windows services for FPS gain is not useful — the improvement is not measurable.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  <img src="/images/processcount/frames.png" alt="Frames example"
       class="rounded border max-w-[70%] mx-auto h-auto">
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  The main effect of disabling services is reducing RAM usage — but the risk is enormous.  
  You can easily break your system to the point that it won't boot without reinstalling Windows.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Event Viewer Flood</h3>

<p class="mb-4">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHSETQRduUU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
     class="text-blue-600 underline">
    This video from Savitarax
  </a>
  shows that disabling services can flood Event Viewer with errors. No benchmarks were provided, but he believes
  the constant error loop can negatively affect performance. Even if it doesn’t, it’s important to know these errors occur.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Conclusion</h3>

<p class="mb-4">
  Don’t chase a low process number for ego.  
  Target specific misbehaving apps using
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
     class="text-blue-600 underline">
    Process Explorer
  </a>.
  Disable startup apps, close unnecessary background apps, and avoid bulk-disabling Windows services.  
  The risks do not outweigh the gains.

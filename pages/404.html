<h4 style="font-size: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">You Aren’t Supposed to Be Here.</h4>
<br>
<p>You’ve taken a wrong turn.</p>
<br>
<p>
The page you’re looking for doesn’t exist… or it used to… before <strong><em>The Incident.</em></strong><br>
Records were wiped. Access revoked. A quiet warning was issued: <em>"If they find it, they’ll find everything."</em>
</p>
<br>
<p>
And yet… here you are. Standing in digital shadows.<br>
A forbidden byte in the wrong place at the wrong time. <em>clocks gun</em>
</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>
But, uh—before this gets weird, maybe you're just lost?<br>
No worries. Happens all the time.
</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>A joke about quantum computers that only makes sense if you're not looking at it.</li>
  <li>A cat who got stuck in the site map (he’s fine now).</li>
  <li>And a warm, friendly button to take you home.</li>
</ul>

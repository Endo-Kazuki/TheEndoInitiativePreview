<h4 style="font-size: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: #b91c1c !important;">You Aren’t Supposed to Be Here.</h4>
<br>
<p>You’ve taken a wrong turn.</p>
<br>
<p>
The page you’re looking for doesn’t exist… or it used to… before <strong><em>The Incident.</em></strong><br>
Records were wiped. Access revoked. A quiet warning was issued: <em>"If they find it, they’ll find everything."</em>
</p>
<br>
<p>
And yet… here you are. Standing in digital shadows.<br>
A forbidden byte in the wrong place at the wrong time. <em>clocks gun</em>
</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>
But, uh—before this gets weird, maybe you're just lost?<br>
No worries. Happens all the time.
</p>
<br>
<p> While we don't have what you were looking for, we <b>do</b> have:
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2"> 
    <li>A joke about quantum computers that only makes sense if you're not looking at it.</li>
    <li>A cat who got stuck in the site map (he’s fine now).</li>
    <li>And a warm, friendly button to take you home.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  You Aren’t Supposed to Be Here.
</h4>
<br>
<p>You’ve taken a wrong turn.</p>
<br>
<p>
The page you’re looking for doesn’t exist… or it used to… before <strong><em>The Incident.</em></strong><br>
Records were wiped. Accesses revoked.
</p>
<br>
<p>
And yet… here you are. Standing in digital shadows.<br>
A forbidden byte in the wrong place at the wrong time... <em>*clocks gun*</em>
</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>
But, <em>uh—</em>before this gets weird, maybe you're just lost?<br>
No worries... <em>*holsters gun*</em> Happens all the time.
</p>
<br>
<h5 class="text-xl">
  While we don't have what you were looking for, we <b>do</b> have:

<p> 
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2"> 
    <li><em>A joke about quantum computers that only makes sense if you're not looking at it.</em></li>
    <li><em>A cat who got stuck in the site map (he’s fine now).</em></li>
    <li><em>And a warm, friendly button to take you home.</em></li>
  </ul>
</p>

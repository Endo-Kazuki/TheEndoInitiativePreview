  <p>Hey, I'm Kazuki Endo, but you can just call me Endo. Neither are my real name but they're the names I prefer to go by. This bio isn't going to be very polished/professional, I'm just going to spew out what I feel.</p>

  <p>Let's start with why use the fake name? Well, I never really was happy of who I grew to be so I started to make drastic changes in my life, name being one of those changes.</p>

  <p>Funny enough it was reading where I found my desire to change myself, webtoons like 'Villain to Kill' and 'The Knight Only Lives Today' that really put me into the mindset of "I really want to train and better myself". So I did... I started my own daily fitness routine, started to learn a language, and really overall just started to take care of myself more. The first 20 years of my life really sucked (21 at the time of writing this in 2025), it was terrible thing after terrible thing. I won't get into the gruesome details of it all, but it suffices me to say that I'm amazed to still be here today, and I'm glad that I am.</p>

  <p>I've found that there's an important job for me, to try to be a pillar of light for others. To change and train myself to be that 'go-to guy' that anyone can count on regardless of what the problem is.</p>

  <p>Obviously I have the dream of being a YouTuber and Author, but my end goal is to get a large piece of land one day and start an institution of sorts where I can take people in and build them up physically and mentally as well, and to help them also shine brightly to others in need. I feel given my own personal experiences in life that I know better than most the darkness that can ail a life, but better yet, I know how to work towards getting out of that darkness too.</p>

  <p>Maybe it shouldn't be much of my business to dedicate my end goal to trying to just help whoever whenever. It's not very profitable monetarily, but it doesn't need to be. It makes me tear a little just thinking about it, but if I can change someone's life and see that visible brightness fill into their eyes... that's all the reward I really need. Something I've come to live by is that service is its own reward, you shouldn't do things in the mindset that you'll be paid back for it.</p>

  <p>Off the topic of my aspirations though, more personal stuff about me is that: blue is my favorite color, if i had to choose between having a cat or dog as a pet, I would easily and every time choose a cat. I was born in 2004 in the Southern US and have lived all over the states. Thunderstorms are my favorite, the worse they are the better I enjoy them. I prefer being out in nature more than being indoors, but being the person that I am, I tend to be inside most of the time. Last real important piece about me is that I have Asperger's (even though it's not technically recognized anymore).</p>

  <p>I spent a while thinking of a way to close out the auto-bio, but I really couldn't think of anything. So I'll just leave with this..</p>

  <p>Thank you for reading, I'm proud of you for getting through life this far, and I hope you keep going strong. Love you lots. I'm here for you.<br>
